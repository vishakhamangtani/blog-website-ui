logo must redirect to your home page
links are not working eg create blog link
hover colors for buttons are different throughout page - keep it consistent and visible
good tht u have tried to make it responsive
good tht u hve inserted comments
navbar collapse is not working fine, it has display none set pls check
there are some classes tht play no role, pls clear that clutter
try adding footer, the get started at end makes it look like it has no value
you have improved your development greatly, just focus on reviews, also try focusing on user experience, here the user trying to click on links takes him nowhere
also, hovering on a blog must give cursor pointer indicating it takes to single blog page
from sign up page there is no rdirect to home page, try adding link to logo
good use of bootstrap
